## Headless Bundle

Hugo supports an amazing feature called **Headless Bundle**, which elegantly resolved the resources publish issue.

For example, if you don't want to publish the resources of the gallery layout, you can create a leaf bundle and specified `headless = true` in `index.md`'s front-matter. These resources will only be used during rendering process. In other word, no file will be generated to `/public` folder.

Checkout [Headless Bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#headless-bundle) for more details.
